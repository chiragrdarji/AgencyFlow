About Dentrix / Open Dental / EagleSoft / Curve Dental Connector

Dentrix Connector App
Effortless Two-Way Sync Between Dentrix & Your CRM

The Dentrix Connector App is designed to help dental practices and marketing agencies seamlessly sync important data between Dentrix (including Dentrix Ascend and Dentrix Enterprise) and your CRM.

Whether you're a dental clinic looking to simplify scheduling and reduce admin work, or a marketing agency aiming to run smarter campaigns with real-time patient data — this app is built for you.

With two-way data transfer, the app keeps your patients, providers, appointments, and payments perfectly in sync between systems — automatically.

 

Key Benefits
Real-Time Scheduling: Show live appointment availability on your website to attract more patients

Smarter Marketing: Use synced Dentrix data to send reminders, confirmations, and promotional offers

One-Way or Two-Way Sync: Choose the setup that fits your workflow

Analytics Dashboard: Monitor sync activity and view pending updates

No More Double Entry: Keep your data clean, current, and connected

Privacy First: The Connector App does not access or transfer any treatment or medical data related to patients. All data is automatically deleted from the connector once it has been successfully transferred to the destination system.
 

How It Works
Install the App from the Marketplace

Choose Your Sync Direction

One-way sync from Dentrix to CRM, or

Two-way sync between Dentrix and CRM

Select What to Sync

Patients

Providers

Appointments

Payments

Map Fields between Dentrix and CRM — just once during setup

Start Syncing – and let the app take it from there

 

Application Flow
Once the app is set up and running:

It uses webhooks to detect newly created or modified records in both Dentrix and your CRM

The data is transformed automatically based on your field mapping selections

The app then syncs the updated data to the destination system

If the sync fails for any reason, it will retry multiple times to ensure the data is delivered successfully

When the same data is modified in both systems, the app compares the last modified timestamp and syncs the most recent version

If both changes occur at the exact same time, Dentrix is treated as the source of truth
